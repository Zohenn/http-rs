# http-rs
A very noob attempt at writing code in Rust.

### todo
- [x] HTTPS support
- [ ] request listener, similar to the one present in native http module in Node.js
- [ ] custom builder-pattern macro
- [ ] keep-alive
- [ ] binary compilation target that serves static files only and reads config from config file
- [ ] multithreading
- [ ] allowing HTTPS and non-HTTPS traffic simultaneously

### mightdo
- [ ] HTTP/2 support
- [ ] something similar to nginx rewrite rules or .htaccess files
